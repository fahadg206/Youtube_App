# YouTube Application

- A YouTube clone that allows a user to search for their favorite videos. This app utlizied the YouTube API offered by Google.

## Project Goals

- This project allowed me to get practice utilizing an API that requires authentication. Also, my goal was to get better in terms of syling and positioning components. I used Semantic UI to help me build a responsive web application. 

## How the app works

- When a user searches for a video, the app will give out a list of videos from the search results. The top video from that list will be displayed in the middle of the page while the other list of videos are put off to the side just like the actual YouTube Website. When a user clicks on a video, the video selected will be displayed front and center on the webpage for the user to watch. 

## Technologies Used

- React, YouTube API, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Axios

## Quick Start

1. Download zip file or clone the repository on your local machine, and open it up in your code editor.
2. In the terminal, run npm install to install all libraries/dependencies allowing you to use the Youtube App.
3. Open terminal and run **npm start** on the root folder.
4. Search any video you would like using the searchbar.
