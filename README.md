YouTube Application

A YouTube clone that allows a user to search for their favorite videos. This app utlizied the YouTube API offered by Google.

Project Goals

This project allowed me to get practice utilizing an API that requires authentication. Also, my goal was to get better in terms of syling and positioning components. I used Semantic UI to help me build a responsive web application. 

How the app works

When a user searches for a video, the app will give out a list of videos from the search results. The top video from that list will be displayed in the middle of the page while the other list of videos are put off to the side just like the actual YouTube Website. When a user clicks on a video, the video selected will be displayed front and center on the webpage for the user to watch.
